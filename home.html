      <p>This is my new website and it's great.
      My task is to become a hacker right now.
      Although Thomas was goofing around with my
    code, I just corected it.</p>

      <p>Hi again! Today I played on a public server on Among Us! I was kind of annoyed because I got killed and ejected several times! Oh yes, I forgot I'll
      send you my link: WWHFWQ.</p>

      <p>Oh. Hi everyone. Today Miss Pritchard and my dad had "parents evening".Miss Pritchard said I was good
    in the term. My dad was so emotional when he heared the news he rewarded me with...Among Us! I was nervous when started because there might be imposters. </p>

      <p>I went to an aqueduct in Pontcysyllte in Wales and walked on top of it. It was cool but some people thought it was scary (including my dad!).
We didn't just go over it, we also went under it. I also liked it because I was with my best friend. We saw a giant hand print on a rock made of lots of
different materials. We did a lot of exercise. I thought it was quite cool, and although it was high, I was not scared.</p>
      <img src="images/aqueduct1.JPG" alt="">
      <p>The aqueduct gave me an amazing idea. I think it'll be a cool one... an aqueduct in Minecraft! Yeah, it's lame but it is quite a cool challenge for me.
I think the aqueduct will be my best build ever. No build of mine will ever be better than this one because it'll rock.I just bet it will.I know it.</p>
