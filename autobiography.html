      My task is to become a hacker right now.

          <h2>My autobiography</h2>

      <p>It was 2012 when I was born in China. I lived in China for four years until I moved to England and found a new home. It only took me three months to learn English and I used to say
"Daddy, your such a paaaaaiiiiiiin!".</p>

      <p>I am into computer games like Minecraft Dungeons. My goal is to get the best set of gear and kill the the Mooshroom Monstrocity without artefacts. Yes, it is going to be hard but I can do it.</p>
      <p>I'd like to work with MOJANG studios (the inventors of Minecraft) as a designer for their team! </p>
      <p>I have been nearly all around the world and explored a lot. I have visited Japan, Thailand, Holland, Spain and Dubai. In the future, I'd like to go to America (to visit my favorite Youtuber in Texas), Italy (to eat pizza!) and France.</p>
      <p>I also help my mum by taking photos of the clothes she sells in her online shop.</p>
