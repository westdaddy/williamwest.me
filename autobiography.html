<div class="panel">
<p>It was 2012 when I was born in China.I lived in China for four years until I moved to England and found a new home. It only took me three months to learn english and I used to say
"Daddy, your such a paaaaaiiiiiiin!".</p>

<p>I am into computer games like Minecraft Dungeons. My goal is to get the best set of gear and kill the the mooshroom monstrocity with out artefacts. Yes it is going to be hard but I can do it.
</p>
    <p>I'd like to work whith the MOJANG studios as a disiner for their team! </p>
      <p>I have nearly been all around the world and explored a lot. I have visited Japan,Thialand,Holand,spain and Dubia. In the future, I'd like to go to America,Itally and France.
